# ITCS 3160 Database design project
Riley Schoppa. I will be working alone


## Introduction
With COVID-19 there is an increasing demand for ordering food online and getting it delivered. 
Given this, online ordering systems should be equipped to handle efficient ordering and delivery process.
This database should be designed to accommodate those needs.

## Use Case
Any entity that would like to run a food delivery service (such as crave on campus) should be able to run this mysql server and have the necessary fields to manage customers, drives, restaurants, and orders


## Business Rules
1. Students should be able to order food as well as deliver food.
2. Food should be able to be ordered to a location
3. A record of order should be kept for each user
4. Valid restaurants to order from must be approved first
5. Users should be able to rate the quality of a delivery
6. Delivery drivers must be approved and have a valid drivers license
7. Orders that have not been fulfilled should be able to be cancelled
